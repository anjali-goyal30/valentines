            Today, on this valentine's day, I gift myself to you. With gifting myself, I give you all the rights over me.<br/>
            When we gift someone something, the gift thereafter belongs to the receiver and he/she is free to do anything, and today I give to all those rights over me!<br />

            This is the biggest gift I could give someone and could not think beyond this as a perfect gift for you. I hope you will handle this gift with care as it is very fragile...<br /><br />
